# üõµ Food Delivery Time Regression Model

This repository contains files used and created as part of a predictive modeling challenge on Kaggle:  
**[Food Delivery Dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gauravmalik26/food-delivery-dataset?select=train.csv)**

The goal was to build a model that accurately predicts delivery times based on order details, geography, time of day, and delivery conditions.

## üìò Background

This project was initially completed as part of **MECH_ENG 329: Mechanistic Data Science for Engineering** at Northwestern University in 2022. It was one of my first end-to-end machine learning projects, and while many decisions now feel rudimentary, it was a foundational learning experience that built my interest in applied modeling.

I recently revisited the project with my current experience as a data analyst to improve the model, with a strong focus on clean, simple, but effective code.

## üìÅ Files

- `FinalReport.pdf`  
  My original college report. It documents the initial model development, context, and results using Random Forest Regression and a simple feed-forward neural network (FNN).  
  **R¬≤ Scores:**  
  - Random Forest: **73.44%**  
  - Feed-Forward Neural Net: **72.78%**

- `DataCleaning.py`  
  Script used to clean the raw Kaggle dataset. Includes:
  - Null value removal
  - Timestamp parsing
  - Geographic distance calculation
  - Categorical encoding
  - Temporal feature creation (e.g., day of week, month)

- `PredictiveModels.py`  
  Initial model training script. Includes:
  - Binary encoding of discontinuous numerical features
  - Model training and evaluation for both RF and FNN

- `train_clean.csv`  
  Cleaned dataset used for modeling. Includes 15 features such as:
  - Driver Age, Driver Rating
  - Traffic Level, Vehicle Condition
  - Festival, Weather Flags, Geo Distance
  - Urban density, Time of day, Rush hour flags
  - A fun surprise: **"Even Month?"**, which surprisingly showed high correlation

- `FollowUpAnalysis.ipynb` / `FollowUpAnalysis.html`  
  **Updated analysis (2025)** ‚Äî A complete overhaul of the original pipeline using modern tools and deeper insights:
  - Enhanced data cleaning and transformation
  - Feature engineering based on delivery time constraints
  - Model comparison with **XGBoost** and **Random Forest**
  - Feature importance visualizations and tuning
  - Significantly improved R¬≤ scores over the original models

## üöÄ Improvements Over the Original

- Cleaned all time fields using true datetime parsing  
- Added geospatial decomposition: `lat_diff`, `lon_diff`, `lat_bucket`  
- Modeled time-based behaviors with `order_hour`, `rush hour`, `weekend`, etc.  
- Used **GridSearchCV** to tune model hyperparameters  
- Integrated **XGBoost**, achieving stronger accuracy and interpretability

## üí¨ Reflections

This project is a good snapshot of how my skills have evolved ‚Äî from understanding the basics of scikit-learn to leveraging structured pipelines and advanced models for better performance. While the original project was valuable, this update reflects a much more production-minded approach to data science.
