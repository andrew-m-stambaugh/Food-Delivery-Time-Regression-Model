# Predicting Food Delivery Times with Machine vs Deep Learning

Note: See the final report for a more detailed explanation of the project's process, development, and results. The code in the appendices of the report is outdated, however. Since this project, I have gone back and made the code much more efficient and neat to more properly demonstrate my ability to write neat ML code.

This repository contains all of the files used and created as part of a data science challenge in Kaggle.
